# Why IeXod

https://github.com/3F/MvsSln/issues/23

## üîç Easy to use

MSBuild with its typical error [[?]](https://github.com/3F/MvsSln/wiki/Advanced-Features#about--possible--problems)

```csharp
// 'The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk' specified could not be found.
new Project("<path to Sdk-style project file>");
```

**[IeXod](https://github.com/3F/IeXod)** üëá

```csharp
new Project("<path to Sdk-style project file>"); // Microsoft.NET.Sdk -> 
/* ~
+ Imports  Count = 30
+ AllEvaluatedItemDefinitionMetadata  Count = 21
+ AllEvaluatedItems  Count = 108
+ AllEvaluatedProperties  Count = 367
...
*/
```

## üîß Configurable Sdk resolvers at runtime:

```csharp
new Project("...", properties, ProjectToolsOptions.Default);

new Project("...", properties, new ProjectToolsOptions(new[] { 
    @"path_to_\sys\resolvers\", 
    @"path2\",
    ...
}));

ProjectToolsOptions.Default.SdkResolvers = new SdkResolver[] { 
    new SysResolver(), 
    new ProdResolver(),
    ...
};
```

## üß¶üéØ Automatic searching of the modern Toolsets

VS setup API + Registry + Configuration files;

That continues direction of https://github.com/3F/hMSBuild

## üî® Exposing Toolsets in classical notation:

```csharp
> {[Current, ToolsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\amd64]}
{[14.0, ToolsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\bin\amd64]}
{[15.0, ToolsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\amd64]}
>> {[16.0, ToolsPath=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\amd64]}
```

## üß∞ Portability, Compatibility, and Functionality

> Modern #MSBuild assemblies are much more closely integrated with #VisualStudio and much more difficult to maintain independently [[?]](https://twitter.com/GitHub3F/status/1184170248532119552)

This is most important goal for [IeXod](https://github.com/3F/IeXod) project. To help to avoid the following nightmare: 

‚ùå From difficulty use (\~ [Microsoft.Build.Locator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Locator/) an official solution) to unpredictable behavior in various products (\~ Visual Studio etc) due to active integration inside a single environment with *Microsoft.Build.*

# IeXod and custom Sdk Resolvers

IeXod provides independent interface for the easiest implementation of any new Sdk Resolvers.

[![NuGet IeXod.SdkResolver](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/IeXod.SdkResolver.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IeXod.SdkResolver/)

Extend evaluation as you need; Then, easily register and configure new resolvers on the fly!
